How to building a pfSense .iso from sources
PiBa-NL edited this page on 18 Apr 2018 · 9 revisions
My steps for building a pfSense 2.4.3dev / FreeBSD 11.1 .iso file. Stuff might be missing, and stuff will change over time, and might not be updated.

Hope this helps you get started at least part of the way. It is still a work in progress, and as you can see ive used MyFirewall as the productname for now..

Prepare a VM to build on
Create VirtualMachine on your favorite hypervisor platform.

CPU: as much as you can spare (building takes a long time and is cpu intensive.. 16 or more vCPU's can be nice to have.)
Mem: 8 GB prefered, no less than 4164MB(to have zfs prefetch enabled..)
Disk: 30 GB should be sufficient
Install / configure FreeBSD
Install the version of FreeBSD that pfsense needs. 11.1 in this case.

allow root to login over ssh (NEVER DO THIS on a production machine, only for testing/easy access)
echo PermitRootLogin yes >> /etc/ssh/sshd_config
service sshd restart
Installing required packages on the the build machine for building the sources..
echo ## Installing required packages
pkg install -y pkg
pkg install -y git
pkg install -y poudriere-devel
pkg install -y mkfile
pkg install -y rsync
pkg install -y nginx
pkg install -y unbound
Configure Nginx to host the package repository on the buildmachine itself
Add to /usr/local/etc/nginx/nginx.conf inside the server { .. } part:

    location /ce/packages/MyFirewall_MyFirewall_2_4_amd64-MyFirewall_devel {
		alias /usr/local/poudriere/data/packages/MyFirewall_MyFirewall_2_4_amd64-MyFirewall_devel;
		autoindex on;
    }
Do we need this one as well?: (To install a pre-build pkg from for example.?. which seems to be required during build iso)

    location /ce/packages/MyFirewall_MyFirewall_2_4_amd64-core {
		alias /usr/local/poudriere/data/packages/MyFirewall_MyFirewall_2_4_amd64-MyFirewall_devel;
		autoindex on;
    }
Start the nginx service: service nginx onestart

DNS
Make sure the dns record release-staging.piba-nl.nl A record points back to the nginx pkg webserver machine.. In this case we are using Unbound on the buildmachine for this task.

Put the localhost nameserver in /etc/resolv.conf so the system will know to use the local unbound installation:
--- /etc/resolv.conf ---

nameserver 127.0.0.1
Create the unbound.conf configuration file, pointing the domainname used for the 'package webserver' (the IP of the buildmachine running nginx):
--- /root/unbound.conf ---

server:  
port: 53  
interface: 0.0.0.0  
local-zone: "piba-nl.nl." static  
local-data: "release-staging.piba-nl.nl. IN A 192.168.0.93"  
forward-zone:  
name: "."  
forward-addr: 192.168.0.1@53  
And start unbound with:

unbound -c /root/unbound.conf
Preparing the environment
Installing optional packages
Install tools that can manage the machine and build process to debug stuff..
screen allows closing ssh session without stopping the running build commands.
ag from the_silver_searcher is a fast code/script/text searcher, if you want to find where a variable is used/defined or a error message might be generated.
htop is a nice 'graphical' top.

pkg install -y screen
pkg install -y the_silver_searcher
pkg install -y htop
rehash
screen
Installing official ports tree as some files are read from /etc/ports/..
(todo find out what exactly.., should it perhaps just be a copy of the FreeBSD-Ports forked repository?)

portsnap fetch extract
Generate repository signing key
This should be hosted on some secure private signing server

cd /root/
openssl genrsa -out repo.key 2048
chmod 0400 repo.key
openssl rsa -in repo.key -out repo.pub -pubout
sh -c '( echo "function: sha256"; echo "fingerprint: $(sha256 -q repo.pub)"; ) > fingerprint'

echo # then it would call the below script from pkg over a ssh connection, for now make it available locally..
cd /root
echo "#\!/bin/sh" > sign.sh
echo "read -t 2 sum" >> sign.sh
echo "[ -z "\"\$sum\"" ] && exit 1" >> sign.sh
echo "echo SIGNATURE" >> sign.sh
echo "echo -n "\$sum" | openssl dgst -sign /root/repo.key -sha256 -binary" >> sign.sh
echo "echo" >> sign.sh
echo "echo CERT" >> sign.sh
echo "cat repo.pub" >> sign.sh
echo "echo END" >> sign.sh
chmod +x /root/sign.sh

echo # 'zroot' zfs volume is required for poudriere (not needed if base FreeBSD system is also installed with ZFS)
cd /usr/MyFirewall/ && mkfile 4G file1
zpool create zroot /usr/MyFirewall/file1
zpool list
Forking repositories. Fork and change the following.
If you use my git repository, it should work as a proof of concept on what is needed to build, but it will be outdated.. and I'm not intending to keep up with new/recent commits changes.. You can however check what commits i added to the 3 repositories to make the MyFirewall build succeed, so you can make similar changes in your own forks..

(==Repository : old-branche > new-branche==)

== pfSense : master > MyFirewall_2_4 ==
Create file: /build.conf using build.conf.sample as a example.
Make sure to set the following options adapted for your domain and git-repositories:

 export PRODUCT_NAME="MyFirewall"
 export FREEBSD_REPO_BASE=https://github.com/PiBa-NL/FreeBSD-src.git
 export FREEBSD_BRANCH=MyFirewall_2_4
 export PKG_REPO_SERVER_STAGING="pkg+http://release-staging.piba-nl.nl/ce/packages"
 export PKG_REPO_SIGNING_COMMAND="/root/sign.sh ${PKG_REPO_SIGN_KEY}"
== FreeBSD-src : RELENG_2_4 > MyFirewall_2_4 ==
Create files from their original counterparts:

/release/conf/MyFirewall*.conf 3x conf
/sys/amd64/conf/MyFirewall
== FreeBSD-ports : devel > devel ==
/sysutils/pfSense-upgrade/files/MyFirewall-upgrade
/sysutils/pfSense-upgrade/files/MyFirewall-upgrade.wrapper
Build the sources
Once the repositories are prepared with all desired/required changes the checkout of repositories and compiling of code and kernel can be done.

Checkout the sources from the main repository
cd /usr && git clone -b MyFirewall_2_4 https://github.com/PiBa-NL/pfsense.git MyFirewall
Now the heavy work starts, several of below steps with 'time' command can take multiple hours to complete
Create the JAIL where the actual compilation of sources will happen in.
If ran a second time the old jail is deleted. (If it appears to do nothing press 'y' and 'enter'..)
Processing time 32 minutes on a 8core+8hyperthreads machine.. Check log in case of problems: /usr/MyFirewall/logs/poudriere.log (it grew to 84MB on first time)

cd /usr/MyFirewall/ && time ./build.sh --setup-poudriere
Expected output last lines:

Done!

This will checkout git ports and rename them from pfSense-pkg-packagename to MyFirewall-pkg-packagename
cd /usr/MyFirewall/ && ./build.sh --update-poudriere-ports
Done!
>>> Operation ./build.sh has ended at Fri Mar 2 22:50:19 CET 2018

Compile all +-500 'ports'..
After this step the files from /usr/local/poudriere/data/packages/MyFirewall_MyFirewall_2_4_amd64-MyFirewall_devel/ can be used to create the package repository make sure it is accessible and matching the servername/url configured in the build.conf. http://release-staging.piba-nl.nl/ce/packages/MyFirewall_MyFirewall_2_4_amd64-MyFirewall_devel/All/

Check for progress/problems:

/usr/MyFirewall/logs/install_pkg_install_ports.txt
/usr/MyFirewall/logs/buildworld.amd64
Troubleshooting..
Check the logs.
Often they will provide a clue about what happened.. Also check onscreen output. If all else fails read the buildscripts and try to find what step could possibly be failing.. There might be a mismatch between ports and pfSense repository expectations. Also not all faults are 'fatal'.. Some can be ignored (without immediately visible issues..)

Once you find a problem try and find any status/progress/error messages that surround it

Start over from nothing..
Even though it will take several hours again.. sometimes its best to just start fresh again.. DELETE OLD FILES :

cd /usr/MyFirewall
# Resets jail file permissions that otherwise might prevent deletion..
chflags -R noschg *
cd ..
# Delete 'everything' .?
rm -r MyFirewall
After this the poudriere ports still exist.. Delete those as well.? Or they wont harm the new build.?...
